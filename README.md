### **Employee Turnover rate:**

Employee Turnover rate is the measurement of the total number of employees who leave an organization in a particular year. 
 Employee Turnover Prediction means to predict whether an employee is going to leave or not leave the organization in the 
coming period.


### **Objectives:**

1. Understanding the core reasons for the high turnover rate.
2. Create a model that can predict whether an employee will leave the company or not.


### **Exploratory Data Analysis:**

- The dataset has 14,999 employees observation and 10 Features.
- No variable column has null/missing values.
- Dataset has 3,008 duplicate values
- 83% of employees stayed and 17% of employees left the company.
- Employees who had a satisfaction rate 0.5 or less tend to leave the company more.
- The average monthly work hours of employees who left the company is more than that of the employees who stayed.
- Most of the employees had experiences between 2-4 years at the company.
- The employees who had workplace accidents are less likely to leave than that of the employee who did not have workplace accidents.

### **Finding:**

I used correlation analysis to determine which factors contribute the most to employee turnover. So, I found that the most correlated was employee satisfaction which had a score of -0.35. A negative correlation means that the likelihood of departure increases as employee satisfaction decreases. And I discovered that the years spent at the company, the number of projects worked, and the employee's average monthly hours had the greatest impact on employee satisfaction.
